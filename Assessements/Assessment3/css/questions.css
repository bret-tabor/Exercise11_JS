/*
    Q3 - What CSS property are you having the most trouble figuring out?
*/
/*Answer: It's not necesarily one property, it is the flex-box properties. If
I don't work with them for a little while I get confused about when to use which property
to achieve the look I'm going for.*/

/*
    Q4 - What is the best CSS property and why?
*/

/* Answer: How can one choose which CSS property is best? That is situational to me.
If I had to choose one, I'd say display. It specifies the type of box used for an
HTML element which can have a big impact on how your website looks and plays a part
how your site behaves as you go from mobil to tablet to desktop.*/
