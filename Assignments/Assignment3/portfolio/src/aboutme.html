    <p>This is the part where I talk about myself and tell you some interesting things about me
         that may or may not influence a positive view about me. Is it working so far? Yes? 
         I thought so, let us continue talking about me. Some activities I like to partake in 
         are playing video games, having some cold brews good friends and cool strangers, going 
         new places, trying new things, eating, and sleeping.
